    <h2>Sample Website</h2>
    <p>This site is a sample site/testing site for HIST7314: Introduction to Digital History at Northeastern University with Ben Schmidt. This is an introduction to creating a website, using HTML, and possibly incorporating CSS for history graduate students enrolled in the class. For this project we will be using Github's Pages and creating minimally-styled but functional webpages.</p>
    <p>As Teaching Assistant to this course, I created this basic page to simulate the process Ben and I provided for our students.</p>
    <p>Part of the assignment is to upload a "CV" page. See mine here: <a href="http://decampda.github.io/cv.html" target="_blank">Totally incomplete and Lazy CV</a></p>
    <p>Link number two: <a href="http://decampda.github.io/alternate" target="_blank">right here</a></p>
